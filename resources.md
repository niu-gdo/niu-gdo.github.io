Here is a collection of Resources you might need or be interested in.

# [Programming basics](https://github.com/niu-gdo/programming-basics 'IGDO Programming Basics repo'){: target="_blank"}

For those new to programming, this repository contains basic programming concepts and examples to help you get started with coding. It covers fundamental topics such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming. Each concept is explained with clear examples and code snippets to facilitate learning.

Follow-along project (Spring 2024) by [Miguel Williams](https://miguelwilliams.dev/).

# [Game Developer's Library](https://niu-gdo.github.io/game-developers-library/)

The Game Developer's Library (GDL) is a repository of articles which serve to educate readers on independent game development. Articles, guides, and tutorials about game development — be it engine-specific guides, general development strategies, or even lower-level concepts in computer graphics — find a home here.

With articles written by our very own [Jake Rogers](https://explosiveeggshells.github.io/), [Marceline Gallegos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marceline-gallegos-461249309/overlay/contact-info/ 'mar-sa-l-een guy-ya-go-s'), and Chris Dejong.
